In the domain of machine learning, the goal of intelligent machines is to be able to solve complex tasks in an environment and find optimal generalization to a new scenario. This is possible  

## How does LISA work?

<!-- Numerical optimization is an important tool in todays machine learning pipeline and optimization algorithms are often used as a black-box tool. Many problems boil down to the minimization (or maximization for that matter) of an objective function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with respect to the input $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. It is important to understand these algorithms and under which conditions they perform well, so that they may be applied. -->
