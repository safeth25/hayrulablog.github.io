This is the first post in a series of posts that I am planning to write on the topic of machine learning. This article introduces fundamental algorithms in numerical optimization. For now, this is the Gradient Descent and Netwon algorithm. I might extend it with momentum based methods and conjugate gradient methods in the future. All of the posts are essentially Jupyter notebooks that I will publish in this repository.

## Introduction

In the domain of machine learning, intelligent machines are designed to solve complex tasks within their einvironemnt and find optimal solutions to new scenarios. The interaction between humans and intelligent machines is also a crucial part of the process. Here it is highly desirable that we can specify instructions in natural language, which then the machines carry out to solve tasks. Hi.
<!-- Numerical optimization is an important tool in todays machine learning pipeline and optimization algorithms are often used as a black-box tool. Many problems boil down to the minimization (or maximization for that matter) of an objective function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with respect to the input $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. It is important to understand these algorithms and under which conditions they perform well, so that they may be applied. -->
