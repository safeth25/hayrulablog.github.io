In this blog post, we introduce LISA: Learning Interpretable Skill Abstractions from Language, which is a hierarchical imitation learning framework that aims to bridge the gap between human language and machine action. LISA is a novel approach to enabling machines to understand and execute complex tasks described in natural language. 

## Introduction

In the domain of machine learning, intelligent machines are designed to solve complex tasks within their environemnt and find optimal solutions to new scenarios. The interaction between humans and intelligent machines is also a crucial part of the process. Here it is highly desirable that we can specify instructions in natural language, which then the machines can carry out to solve tasks.
