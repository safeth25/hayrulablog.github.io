In this blog post, we introduce LISA: Learning Interpretable Skill Abstractions from Language, which is a hierarchical imitation learning framework that aims to bridge the gap between human language and machine action. LISA is a new approach to enabling machines to understand and execute complex tasks described in natural language. LISA has been tested on navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, and it outperforms a strong non-hierarchical baseline in low data regimes. 

## Introduction

In the domain of machine learning, intelligent machines are designed to solve complex tasks within their environment and find optimal solutions to unseen scenarios. The interaction between humans and intelligent machines is also a crucial part of the process. In the sequential-decision making environment, given expert data, an agent can learn to perform these tasks via multi-task imitation learning (IL). The task specification to an agent may happen through task ID, goal images or goal demonstrations. However, these specifications demand effort and may be hard to manage and supply during testing. Here it is highly desirable that we can specify instructions in natural language, which then the machines can carry out to solve long-horizon tasks.
